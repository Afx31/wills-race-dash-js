# Wills Race Dash - JavaScript(Web) edition
A Raspberry Pi CANBus race dash display for my race car.

Goal: Create a software application to retrieve the can bus data from my race car's Hondata ECU chip and display it on a heads up display. Add additional features like data logging, data sync via cloud, analytics & option to add additional external sensors.

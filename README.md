# WillTech - Race Dash - JavaScript edition

**Disclaimer**
- No longer working on this
- Currently building a Go implementation of this [WT - Race Dash](https://github.com/Afx31/wt-race-dash)

This is my first implementation of a telemetry dash which reads CANBus data from my race car's ECU to display the data real-time via a Raspberry Pi 4 + 7" LCD.

This was the initial proof of concept, with using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for quick UI mapping, I went with a JavaScript backend. Surprisingly it worked quite well, but I seeked the structure of a typed language along with concurrency.
